#Here, the code and any associated metadata should be explained as best as possible.

This is a test example for trial purposes.

The data was part of experiment XYZ, collected in the period 24.12.2021 - 05.01.22 at GSI Helmholtzzentrum f√ºr Schwerionenforshung GmbH, with experiment number G-22-00123
The experimental instrument used was the DESPEC setup coupled to the SHIP separator.

None of this represents any real scientific data or analysis, and should only be used for test purposes.

The two codes are for randomly generated datasets which can be found here:
Result Datasets
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7274418

The codes extracts data from the .csv data files, cleans the dataset, and perform a very basic Gaussian fit. 
Software_TestResultData1.ipynb can be used with TestResultData1.csv
Software_TestResultData2.ipynb can be used with TestResultData2.csv

The codes can be used with JuypterLab, or Juypter Notebook, which is avaibale in a webbrowser without the need to install any software locally.
